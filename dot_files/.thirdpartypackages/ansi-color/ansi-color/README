INSTALLATION
------------

Since it is written in bash script, this color command should work on most, if
not all terminal emulators that run /bin/bash.

You can install this script using the supplied Makefile by issuing 'make install'.
Removal of the script is also a simple 'make remove'.

If you do not have sudo access, simply ensure this
script is executable, using something like 'chmod 755 color', and place it into
a directory included within your PATH environment variable.

If you are packaging this script; use 'make VERSION=XXX build' to create archives
for the XXX version of the script. If you omit the VERSION variable, the version
will default to "latest".

USAGE
-----

color [ effect ] [ [ lt ] fgcolor ] [ bgcolor ]

color list

color [ -h | --help ]

where:

fgcolor and fgcolor are one of black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan 
or white.

effect can be any of [ nm | normal ], [ bd | bold ], [ ft | faint ], 
[ it | italic ], [ ul | underline ], [ bk | blink ], [ fb | fastblink ], 
[ rv | reverse ], [ iv | invisible ]

Preceed the fgcolor with lt to use a light color -- the light or faint 
intensity effect is not commonly implemented within terminal emulators 
or consoles.

color off or just color resets to default colors and text effects.

color list displays all possible color combinations. 

EXAMPLES
--------

  echo "$(color ul)Underlined text$(color off)"

  echo "Make $(color rv)this$(color nm) reverse video text"

  echo "$(color white blue) White text on a blue background $(color)"

  echo "$(color ltyellow green) lt prefix on the yellow text text $(color off)"

  echo "$(color bold red yellow blink) Blinking bold red text on a yellow 
  background $(color)"

Note that results may vary with these standard ANSI escape sequences because of 
the different configurations of terminal emulators. 

INSPIRATION & CREDIT
--------------------

This script was quickly written after I lost the source for Moshe Jacobson's 
color command. Being compiled, his creation was much quicker but the binary was 
not portable across the platforms I used. I wrote this in shell script figuring 
that it would work across the widest selection of command lines.

While the syntax is compatible with Moshe's command, I wanted to add the 
ability to use multiple text effects and colors in one invocation and add a few 
more ANSI escape sequences.

Many thanks to Moshe Jacobson.
